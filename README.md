# Power-Supply-Module

In this project, I designed a Power Supply Module using KiCad that includes the LM7805 regulator to ensure a stable and reliable power output. 
The LM7805 regulator can deliver an output current of up to 1.5A, and the typical constant output voltage is 5V but can range between 4.8V and 5.2V. 
the minimum input voltage should be 7V, while the maximum should be 35V.
I also tested the circuit using Proteus 8 to make sure it works well and is reliable before building it.
